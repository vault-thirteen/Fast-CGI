**Notes**

*Please note that GitHub still has an annoying bug in links:*  
*Not all parts of a clickable link are really clickable.*  
*When the link does not work, click on a textual part of the link.*  
*Five (5) years have passed since the purchase of GitHub by Microsoft, and this 
bug is still present.*
