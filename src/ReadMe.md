# Fast CGI Compatibility Layer
### For Go Programming Language

<!-- TC -->

This library provides objects, methods and functions to work with FastCGI 
interface in Go programming language.

The library implements methods for a FastCGI <b>client</b>, mostly.

Implementation of a FastCGI <b>server</b> can be found in a built-in standard library 
of Go language â€“ `net/http/fcgi` package, https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/fcgi.

## Usage

Usage examples can be found in the ['example'](example) folder.

A test application performing an execution of a simple PHP script is here:  
[cmd/RunSimplePhpScript](cmd/RunSimplePhpScript)

The most simple usage example requires only a few lines of code and is as 
simple as the following code:
```go
TODO
```

For more complex tasks, the `Client` object and its methods can be used.

## Why ?

<b>Reason 1</b> 

> <b>FastCGI</b> interface provides a cross-platform and 
cross-language interface for communication between totally different programming 
language. For example, with the help of <b>FastCGI</b> it is possible to call 
a function of a PHP language from the code written in Go language, where Go is 
a compiled language and PHP is an interpreted language with no runtime 
"engine".

<b>Reason 2</b>

> <b>FastCGI</b> interface is still actual for simple tasks and 
applications where client code is not a bottleneck, e.g. for applications using 
a lot of complicated SQL queries, such as bulletin boards and online forums.

<b>Reason 3</b>

> There are a lot of programming languages which still support the 
<b>FastCGI</b> interface. And many of these languages are mature and 
are sufficient for their purposes.

<b>Reason 4</b>

> This library allows to bring a new life into old projects 
written in other programming languages that support the <b>FastCGI</b> 
interface. It is not necessary to re-write PHP projects in Go from scratch. 
This is why it is said in this repository, that this project is a compatibility 
layer.
